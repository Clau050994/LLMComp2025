CBP Rule 34.7.112 governs the importation of personal electronic devices (PEDs) for non-commercial use. This includes items such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, and e-readers that are carried by travelers for personal or professional use, excluding any devices intended for sale or distribution. Commercial shipments fall under separate regulations (19 CFR ¬ß¬ß 141‚Äì144). PEDs are defined as portable, electricity-powered devices capable of data storage, computation, or wireless communication. Non-commercial use refers to any use that does not involve resale, leasing, or profit-generating distribution. All travelers entering the U.S. must declare PEDs valued over $2,500 or those purchased within 60 days of entry. Devices under the $800 threshold per 19 U.S.C. ¬ß 1321 are duty-exempt if the exemption hasn‚Äôt been used in the prior 30 days. Every PED may be inspected by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) via physical, x-ray, or forensic examination (per CBP Directive No. 3340-049A). CBP officers are legally empowered (under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1357 and 19 U.S.C. ¬ß 1582) to search devices at the border without a warrant. Refusing inspection can result in detention (19 U.S.C. ¬ß 1499) and denial of entry. Forensic exams must be completed in 15 days unless extended under 19 CFR ¬ß 162.7. Any data retrieved is handled under DHS/CBP-006 (Automated Targeting System), with a retention window of up to 75 years. Data may be shared with DHS, FBI, and foreign partners. There are no categorical exemptions based on citizenship; U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and visa holders are all subject to these rules. Diplomats must present credentials to claim immunity (8 CFR ¬ß 235.1). Journalists‚Äô materials are protected under the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, though inspection is allowed if national interest is proven and supervisor approval is granted. Failure to declare PEDs for commercial intent or exceeding value limits may be punished under 19 U.S.C. ¬ß 1592, with possible seizure and fines. False declarations (CBP Form 6059B or verbal) are punishable under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1001, including possible criminal prosecution. Repeat violations may impact eligibility for expedited entry programs like Global Entry or SENTRI.
